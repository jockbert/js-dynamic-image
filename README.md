Dynamic Image
===

Enables dynamic change of image source based on `img`-element width change. 

A usage scenario is to only load scaled down versions of large photos on devices with small screens.

See file [example_usage.htm](example_usage.htm) for example usage. In the example, image updates are triggered by using `window.onresize`.
